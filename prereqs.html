                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In the Learning Management System (LMS) web application, courses are managed for different customers
                    that procure course materials that Pelesys provides. This project focuses on redesigning the
                    outdated prerequisite-building tool embedded within one activity of a course in the Learning
                    Management System (LMS). This tool is used by administrators to set conditions for unlocking
                    specific activities, nested courses, or blocks within a course's hierarchy.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Activity</strong>: A module within a course that serves as a building block of the
                            overall learning
                            experience, customized by Pelesys or by the customer‚Äôs administration team.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: A set of conditions that must be met to give the trainee
                            access
                            to a specific
                            activity or module within the course.</p>

                <p>I was responsible for modernizing and enhancing the user experience of the prerequisite-building
                    tool, replacing the outdated version in the old UI with a design that is intuitive, functional, and
                    visually engaging.</p>

                <h2>Existing Challenges</h2>
                <p>The existing prerequisite-building tool was part of the legacy Galaxy system, which hadn‚Äôt undergone
                    a UI revamp since the 1990s. This outdated design presented several significant challenges that
                    hindered usability and frustrated administrators.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Rigid Functionality</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The interface lacked flexibility, making it impossible to rearrange operators or the
                                    items being operated on after placement.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Crammed and Confined Layout</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The entire tool was squeezed into a small modal. Although a drag handle allowed some
                                    resizing, the cramped space made it difficult to work comfortably.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>At least two customers explicitly requested moving away from modals, citing usability
                                    concerns.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The buttons for adding operators (e.g., <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>,
                                    <code>NOT</code>) were tiny and difficult to click, leading to frequent user
                                    frustration.
                                </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Syntax validation was not live. Users had to click a button every time they wanted to
                                    check their expression, adding unnecessary steps and slowing down their workflow.
                                </p>

                                <p>The only guidance available was four static examples of valid expressions,
                                    accompanied by basic descriptions of what they meant.</p>

                                <p>There was no way to get help with individual operators or symbols, leaving users
                                    stranded if they didn‚Äôt fully understand the tool's syntax or logic.</p>

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>The primary source of inspiration for this project was Scratch, a block-based programming language
                    designed for children who are receiving their first exposure to computer programming. Its
                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach is colorful, user-friendly, and emphasizes clarity. Key
                    takeaways from Scratch included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A visual approach to optimize readability.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clear differentiation of elements through colours.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>To align with the goals of this redesign, I conceptualized a drag-and-drop interface. Here‚Äôs the
                    structure I devised for the prerequisite sub-tab:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Operators</strong>: These include <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>,
                            <code>NOT</code>, <code>result</code>, and <code>parentheses</code> (later replaced by
                            Groups for clarity). They are housed at the top of the view.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Mini Tree</strong>: A compact representation of the course structure. Each element
                            has a unique short code. These elements are static and cannot be reordered but can be
                            dragged into the building area.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Builder Area</strong>: The primary workspace where operators and elements from the
                            Mini Tree combine to form prerequisites.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Utility Buttons</strong>: Positioned at the bottom, they allow users to clear the
                            Builder Area and access support documentation.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>The transition from the old, uninspired UI to the new, user-friendly design required balancing
                    creative freedom with strict adherence to an existing design system. Drawing inspiration from
                    Scratch's UI, which was vastly different from my usual references, provided fresh perspectives.</p>
                <h3>Future Possibilities</h3>
                <p>The current design serves its purpose effectively but leaves room for expansion. A modal-based
                    approach, though not favored by most of the team, could further enhance focus and usability if
                    designed intentionally for this specific context. It would especially be the case if we were to make
                    the LMS application available for tablets.</p>
