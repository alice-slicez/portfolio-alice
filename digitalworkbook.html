                <h2>Overview/Background</h2>
                <p>In late 2020, amidst the ongoing uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on primary
                    education, our team was approached by a long-standing sales representative to collaborate with BJU
                    Press, a key customer in the EdTech sector. The objective was to conceptualize a digital workbook
                    that closely mirrored the seamless experience of a traditional physical workbook. The project
                    generated significant interest due to the growing demand for adaptable educational solutions during
                    this transformative period.</p>
                <p>This project has been white-labeled to ensure compliance with NDA requirements. Certain aspects of
                    the research have been omitted for confidentiality. For further information, please feel free to
                    contact me.</p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>Collaborating with one designer colleague, I actively contributed to every stage of the design
                    process.
                    This included conducting research, developing personas, creating use cases, gathering design
                    inspiration, and producing mockups. Despite a tight timeline of just 2.5 weeks and balancing other
                    ongoing design responsibilities, we delivered a solid design concept with room to grow.</p>

                <h2>UX Research</h2>
                <p>Since direct interviews with BJU Press representatives were not possible, we developed a set of
                    targeted questions for our sales representative to relay, allowing us to gather insights into how
                    their educational resources were utilized.</p>
                <p>We also drew inspiration from ongoing UX work aimed at enhancing the flagship <a
                        href="https://evidentpoint.com/products/activetextbook/">ActiveTextbook reader</a>,
                    which provided a strong foundation for our design approach. Additionally, BJU Press supplied us with
                    sample elementary-level math, English, and history textbooks, enabling us to closely examine the
                    materials used by teachers and students.</p>

                            the spirit of engaging, hands-on exercises. For older students and teachers, the focus
                            shifts to streamlining the learning experience with customizable, accessible features that
                            cater to individual needs. Teachers should have a clear view of student progress, enabling

                            grade 6 and 7).</p>

                        <p><strong>New Student Inclusion:</strong> When a new student joins my class, I want to include
                            them in an ongoing assignment and set an extended due date, so that they have a fair chance
                            to complete the work without being penalized for starting late.</p>

                            absence, I want to include them in an ongoing assignment, set an extended due date, and
                            manually override missed assignments grades with an ‚Äúexempt‚Äù status so that their progress

                            due to withdrawal, I want to reallocate grading as needed, so that the group‚Äôs performance

                            align closely with the learning objectives of the physical workbook, so that my educational
                            experience is consistent and effective without unnecessary adjustments.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Disputing Grades:</strong> When I believe my grade on an assignment is incorrect, I
                            want a way to dispute the grade and provide justification for a review, so that I can ensure
                            my work is evaluated fairly and any errors are corrected.</p>

                <p>The idea is to explore the toggle state for input tools from a student view on an iPad or equivalent
                    tablet. There is the ability for typing input as well as handwriting input. The student can erase or
                    undo their input, mark certain questions as ‚Äúteacher help needed‚Äù, and search for different parts of
                    the homework, jumping to results.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>This project required significant work within a constrained timeline.</p>
                <p>If additional time had been available, we would have explored how the nuances of different school
                    subjects could inform distinct design elements and features. Furthermore, we would have delved into
                    ways teachers could leverage class analytics to enhance their instruction and monitor student
                    progress.</p>
                <p>Future iterations of the digital workbook could include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Randomized Questions</strong> for replicable practice, enabling students to reinforce
                            their knowledge through varied exercises.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Semantic Insight Marking</strong> to analyze question types students struggle with,
                            track time spent on tasks, and provide actionable feedback.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Collaboration Features</strong> allowing synchronization between teachers
                            managing the same homeroom class, particularly useful in elementary and middle school
                            settings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Support for External Books</strong>, accommodating scenarios where overlays or direct
                            integrations are not feasible.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Extended Accessibility Features for Students</strong>, accommodating a greater
                            breadth of student needs including but not limited to Dyslexia-friendly typefaces, reading
                            ruler tools, customizing page zoom level, integrations for students with English as a
                            foreign language, etc.</p>

                <p>These enhancements would broaden the workbook‚Äôs functionality and further support diverse teaching
