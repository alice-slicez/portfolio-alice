                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Coquitlam River Community Garden, formerly known as the Colony Farm Community Garden, is a
                    not-for-profit organization dedicated to promoting sustainable and organic gardening while fostering
                    a strong sense of community. The organization had been in need of a website redesign for three
                    years. As a member and gardener at the time, I volunteered to take on the project.
                    The state of the website in January 2023, the time of starting this project, is linked <a
                        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230603205223/https://www.cfcg.ca/about-us/">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    I led the website redesign project by conducting user research, identifying usability issues on the
                    existing site, and creating high-fidelity mockups for the new design. I coordinated responsibilities
                    within a team of three, which included myself, the garden president, and the webmaster.
                    Additionally, I presented progress updates to both the community garden president and the
                    administrative assistant.

                    <a href="./assets/img/CRCG/usabilityresponse.png" target="_blank">

                    </a>
                </div>
                <h3>Usability Assessment</h3>
                <p>I created the script for the website usability assessment to evaluate the initial usability of the
                    CRCG website. The script focuses on user acceptance testing, including three key tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Task 1: Locate the item ‚ÄúPlot #10 ‚Äì Artichokes.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>Task 2: Find the list of garden contacts. </li>
                    <li>Task 3: Identify the date of the first work party in 2024.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The assessment was conducted via Google Forms and distributed to five garden members and one external
                    tester. Participants were diverse in age, tech proficiency, and English language skills.
                    Including an external participant provided insights into the experience of prospective new members
                    seeking to contact the admins or register for a plot. Full script is <a

                </p>
                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>A competitive analysis was performed to identify potential features and strategies by examining other
                    community gardens and equivalent organizations. This process inspired feature identification,
                    rationalization, benchmarking, trend awareness, and UX enhancement.</p>
                <p>Key competitors included Riley Park Community Gardens and Skookum Foods, both of which had
                    significantly more polished websites.</p>
                <p>The methodology involved:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Feature Comparison Chart‚Äì Highlighting features competitors offered that CRCG lacked or could
                        improve.</li>
                    <li>Task-Based Analysis ‚Äì Evaluating three common tasks:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reading about the mission or history of the organization.</li>
                            <li>Accessing documents with learning resources.</li>
                            <li>Registering for membership.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>For any tasks without a direct equivalent, the closest match was analyzed. Steps were recorded for
                    each task, along with their actions, and evaluated against Nielsen Norman‚Äôs 10 Usability Heuristics
                    to identify violations and areas for improvement.</p>

                <h3>Wireframe Sketches</h3>
                <p>I created a series of wireframe sketches to explore
                    layout, grid structures, and the general feel of the redesigned website. These sketches guided
                    decisions around placement and content hierarchy before transitioning to a digital design platform
                    like Figma.

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>

                <p><strong>Accessibility Focus:</strong> Designing for an audience that is
                    predominantly senior-aged required careful consideration of accessibility standards, such as
                    WCAG
                    contrast compliance and user-friendly features.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Collaborative Leadership:</strong> My role was to guide the
                    team by sharing my expertise, not imposing decisions. I took an active leadership role by:

                <ul id="14d77335-6ee3-8086-b87d-e71d36b3a504" class="bulleted-list">
                    <li>Allocating duties, such as organizing participants for user research.</li>
                    <li>Teaching UX and design principles, emphasizing their
                        importance to the project.</li>
                    <li>Actively gathering team input to align the website‚Äôs vision with their goals.</li>
                    <li>This experience reinforced the importance of balancing expert guidance with collaborative
                        decision-making to achieve a shared vision.</li>

                <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
                <ul class="bulleted-list">
                    <li>The team plans to adopt the tool Signup Genius to streamline
                        work party registration, a feature that aligns with my usability suggestions.</li>
                    <li>Though the Google Translate browser extension can be utilized to
                        support users with English as a non-native language, there had been discussion for utilizing
                        translation tools for larger PDF files that cannot be immediately converted to a webpage (ie.
                        bylaws).</li>
                    <li>The website is currently being updated in stages based on my
                        recommendations.</li>
