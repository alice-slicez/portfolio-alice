                <p>Sticky notes is a design feature for the company‚Äôs flagship web-based reader. 
                    The reader is rapidly developing to better accommodate online learning and 
                    adapt to the unprecedented educational landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <p>One of our clients wanted an annotation feature where students can write notes for themselves. The notes would always present on top of text and draggable across the page. Along with the design team, upper management decided to revisit the current version of sticky notes and make improvements.</p>

                <p>To get an idea on improving the current version of sticky notes, I researched the sticky notes on different operating systems and noted specific functionalities that I wanted to transfer to sticky notes in the reader</p>

                <h2>Product Improvement</h2>
                <p>My teammate did previous groundwork on the sticky notes, so I built upon that work by including the minimize and lock features. To address the previous dimension problem, it was decided that the note will be sandwiched between a top and bottom area, 48px tall each, which will support the editing/deletion buttons and note colours. When creating a note, the initial input area height will be enough for two lines of text.</p>

                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>Another design I created includes a feature to lock the note to prevent accidental editing, and the ability to minimize a note in case the user wanted to focus on reading. In this design, the delete functionality is within editing mode.</p>

                <h2>Final Iteration</h2>
                <p>After presenting the above designs, the decision was made to keep the note simple without the lock and minimize feature, as it was too early to implement them. We were also uncertain if they would be useful, as most of our users who utilized notes liked to keep them open.</p>
                <div class="image-holder">

                </div>
                <p>As the previous UI cluttered the editing and deletion tools, the decision was to make a single floating action button that changes functionality depending on the note‚Äôs state. Rich text tools were implemented to support accessibility needs, such as font size. Due to the need for more icons, the colour selection menu was redesigned to expand out.</p>

                    <p class="caption">Along with conventional colours, a dark and sepia option are available for the note to accommodate accessibility needs.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>The above mockups were proposed to clients in a Zoom meeting, and they felt positively about the direction that sticky notes were going. They recommended an article about the usability research done on note-taking, which I plan to draw knowledge from when working on future iterations.</p>
                <p>Future plans for sticky notes include the desire to have them privacy-scoped to specifically individual users, other students, and teachers. If we make this feature available to different clients, we could also implement their branding colours as background colours for the notes.</p>
