                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In this case study for the <a href="https://uxdesigncontest.com/contests/ux-design-contest-13.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX Design Contest 13</a>, I discovered and prioritized usability issues on the T&T Supermarket Grocery Delivery process on their desktop website. I have proposed two improvements to clarify the process of arriving at the shopping page, to distinguish between delivery and pickup, and to easily use the shopping cart.</p>
                <p>T&T Supermarket is a Canadian grocer selling Asian-imported goods. Most of T&T's clientele are of Asian descent, and a number of them shop at T&T as they face a language barrier with most western grocery stores.</p>
                <p>I chose to improve T&T‚Äôs website because the large Asian-Canadian population in Vancouver often rely on T&T's services, be it for a celebration cake or a weekday dinner. With the pandemic, a large number of T&T's customers will opt to use the online delivery service. Whether it is in English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese, improvements in the website's usability will help customers of all ages and language abilities to find what they need with ease. From a business perspective, this is a strategy to maintain customer loyalty of those who prefer Asian grocers.</p>

                <h2>Identifying Usability Issues</h2>
                <p>To identify usability issues, I went to the <a href="https://www.tntsupermarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T&T supermarket website</a> and went through the process of adding items to my cart until the final checkout screen.</p>
                <details> 
                    <summary>List of Found Usability Issues</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Default language upon first landing screen is not in English in a country where usually, the first expected language of a website is English</li>
                        <li>Language selection screen not distinct enough - too much cognitive load to make it share a modal with the address input field</li>
                        <li>Lack of iconography in modal - address field has no location icon indicating what it does - takes more time for user to read</li>
                        <li>Loading animation is awkwardly positioned inside the language and address modal</li>
                        <li>It is not a conventional loading icon - might confuse some users, but this is a nitpick</li>
                        <li>Address should be in its own modal</li>
                        <li>asks for specific address at first - too demanding of user commitment - Ideally the website would ask permission to use the user&#x27;s location</li>
                        <li>but if not, there could be a field to select a province</li>
                        <li>after province is selected, move on to city</li>
                        <li>Even after asking for address, it lacks customization in showing information about the closest T&amp;T locations permissible for delivery</li>
                        <li>Sliding images on the &quot;hero area&quot; banner distracting</li>
                        <li>Only one or two of these images are about COVID-19 notices. Rest are about promotions. As an essential business, the COVID-19 should be the clearest thing the user sees initially</li>
                        <li>Sliding text on top distracting</li>
                        <li>Is about promotions but without an image it&#x27;s meaningless</li>
                        <li>Home page categories - pills have too many ampersands. More pills per section &gt; &quot;Rice &amp; Oils &amp; Flour&quot;</li>
                        <li>UI has poor legibility overall</li>
                        <li>Three navbars on the top feel cluttered</li>
                        <li>No clear CTA on how to start adding groceries to cart</li>
                        <li>Poor wording on &quot;Click and Collect&quot;. It actually meant pickup in store - some kind of reservation system</li>
                        <li>Pickup address does not show in a visible place after it is saved</li>
                        <li>Delivery for Home only shows limited goods in its list - most goods (produce, seafood, etc) are found under &quot;Click and Collect&quot;</li>
                        <li>Search bar results show too many details.</li>
                        <li>Location of search bar makes it unclear to scope. Am I searching through the catalogue of goods, or does it encompass more?</li>
                        <li>Absence of filtering system for search bar</li>
                        <li>Categorization for Delivery for Home items unclear</li>
                        <li>also lacking in important information. Does the user care about brand and price? Is it important to see if the item is out of stock?</li>
                        <li>Minimal or absence of rating information for several products - unnecessary to show rating in listings page</li>
                        <li>Awkward positioning for &quot;Added to Cart&quot; notification. The element on the page not strong enough to call attention. </li>
                        <li>Viewing cart items and going to checkout are two separate pages</li>
                        <li>Can only remove items on the cart page</li>
                        <li>Cannot see list of items already added to cart without leaving the page currently being browsed</li>
                        <li>Chat button is awkwardly positioned</li>
                    </ul>

                    <summary>Issues specific to logging in and checkout</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the option to log in with social media only includes Google and Facebook, which doesn't accommodate users who prefer social media platforms popular in Asia such as WeChat or Line</li>
                        <li>Wechat has its own payment function, which should be considered</li>
                        <li>Must log in to check out - an essential business shouldn't demand a heavy commitment for their services during a pandemic</li>
                        <li>Checkout screen asks for first name, last name, phone number - should already know this if user is signed in to their account</li>
                        <li>Checkout screen is in a modal that takes up the entire screen - takes the user's attention away from contextual information

                        <li>Insufficient payment platforms available - If Alipay and Wechat pay are supported, the payment methods that are typically accepted in North America (PayPal, Google Pay) should be accepted too - especially since user can log in with Google</li>
                        <li>"Buy More Save More" image on the checkout page is not indicative of function, doesn't imply where  user is going after they click the button to leave that page

                    <li>Unclear navigation to shopping page(s)</li>
                    <li>Lack of differentiation between deliverable and pick-up only items</li>
                    <li>Cannot see list of items in cart without leaving current shopping page</li>

                    <summary>Prioritizing Usability Issues</summary>
                    <p>Because most of the usability issues I found initially were higher-order issues with significant impact on the user experience, I focused on some major usability issues over minor design issues in the categorization below. </p>

                    <p>After filtering out the high impact issues, it appears that the most important issues are part of either the on-boarding or the shopping procedure. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>On-boarding process lacks structure - asks for too much information at once</li>
                        <li>Unclear navigation to shopping page(s)</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Top Issue: Improve clarity in accessing user customization, which reduces cognitive load in finding desired items.</span></p>
                    <p>I decided to improve the shopping navigation and customization of shopping items, as it is the core of the online shopping experience. This was chosen over the on-boarding process because the shopping experience should be solid, no matter the display language, Delivery address is in already in a visible area, allowing it to be easily changed.</p>

                    <p><em>The images in the other one was less inviting</em></p>
                    <p><em>Cleaner layout</em></p>
                    <p><em>Things I click most (cart, login/register, shop online) are easiest to see and use</em></p>
                    <p><em>Cleaner, more concentrated colors (other one felt like too many different colors are together). big simple banner in the middle, looks more professional and minimalistic.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Webpage is easy to read and digest quickly, direct links to whatever I may most likely want/need to access.</em></p>
                    <p><em>There's miniscule difference. I just like the promotional imagery being immediately shown.</em></p>
                    <p><em>It designates the location as to where the delivery would be going to.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Information displayed clearly and precisely. no unnecessary information clogging the space</em></p>

                    <p><em>Everything is listed on the side; it's more neat</em></p>
                    <p><em>It's clean</em></p>
                    <p><em>Clean interactive page, shows items with names and prices clearly.</em></p>
                    <p><em>I like the cart listing on the right; being able to see amounts is important because I often accidentally add more than what I want, or there's a page loading issue at some point and I become unsure of what's in my cart</em></p>
                    <p><em>Sleek and modern design, showcasing what is currently in your cart. the other style is more oldschool. However the one I chose is slightly better at keeping track of what you already purchased so you don't buy too much.</em></p>

                <h2>Recommendations for T&T Supermarket</h2>
                <p>My recommendations for T&T Supermarket are mostly to think about the visual hierarchy in their website and how intuitive it is for a user no matter which language they prefer. Apart from a more concrete design system, I would recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a CTA button linking directly to the shopping page </li>
                    <li>Unify all shopping items under one page instead of segregating them between Delivery and Pick-up (and labeling "Pick-up" ambiguously)</li>
                    <li>Adding a shopping cart as a drawer so users can add and remove items on the fly</li>
                    <li>Though it is outside of my design concepts, do not make the user sign up for online membership before purchasing items, <strong>especially</strong> during the pandemic</li>
                    <li>It is also too demanding to request the user input a specific address before they even begin shopping. Just make them input a province and city, and ask for the rest once the user is ready to commit to a purchase</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
                <p>Working backwards and setting myself to-do lists really helped me outline my tasks. I will be using Notion for future design and portfolio documentation</p>
                <p>Setting timers for certain tasks where going down a rabbit hole is too easy</p>
                <p>An improvement for next time: start earlier during the week so I can gain more of my coworkers' feedback and flesh my ideas out more. I can learn more about conducting testing from them too</p>
                <p>As of September 2021, the T&T website UI has improved vastly from when I did this case study.</p>
